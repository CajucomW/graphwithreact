## UPDATE: API link no longer operational

After checking in on the ol' app, it seems that the API link does not work any longer. Currently looking to replace.

## A Simple Graph Application

Working on a simple Bar Graph app for stock market prices. The app currently has an input field to enter stock market symbols whose current prices appear on the graph.

Link to Heroku App [here](https://whispering-thicket-32277.herokuapp.com/).

TODO: 

- at input, search API for valid stock market symbols
    - app breaks otherwise
- FIX code format
- improve mobile responsiveness
- styling improvements
