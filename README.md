## A Simple Graph Application

Working on a simple Bar Graph app for stock market prices. The app currently has an input field to enter stock market symbols whose current prices appear on the graph.

TODO: 

- add function that removes Bars/Items in graph
- produce error message when item in search bar is invalid/missing
- styling improvements
