## A Simple Graph Application

Working on a simple Bar Graph app for stock market prices. The app currently has an input field to enter stock market symbols whose current prices appear on the graph.

TODO: 

- at input, search API for valid stock market symbols
    - app breaks otherwise
- FIX code format
- improve mobile responsiveness
- styling improvements
